# Verilog-Coding-
Welcome to my Verilog learning repository! This repo contains basic to intermediate Verilog codes I learned and tested using the Basys 3 FPGA development board.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Vivado Design Suite** (WebPACK edition – Free)
- **Basys 3 Board** (Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA)

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `projects/`: Contains individual Verilog modules + testbenches + simulation images.
- `basys3_bitstreams/`: Contains `.bit` files that can be uploaded to Basys 3.
- `Vivado_Installation_Guide.md`: Step-by-step Vivado setup instructions.
- `docs/`: Useful learning resources and notes.
